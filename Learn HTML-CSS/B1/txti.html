    <h1>Txti has retired.</h1>
    <p>
      Txti was created in 2014 with a simple and benevolent mission: to play a
      part in a more globally accessible internet. Our slogan was "fast web
      pages for everybody," and it worked! Txti served millions of people, with
      well over half a million fast web pages created. Since then, the whole
      world has changed. Now, there is less need for web pages that work on flip
      phones, and more need for trustworthiness and safety on the internet. As
      txti is not able to keep up with this need, it's time for it to step aside
      to ensure we're not causing harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you to everyone who used and loved txti. It was a fun and useful
      project that I simply wasn't able to maintain. There are many lessons
      learned here, but I'm grateful to have been a part of a
      <a href="">special</a> <a href="">era</a> of the internet's evolution.
    </p>
    <p>Peace and love,</p>
    <p>B</p>
